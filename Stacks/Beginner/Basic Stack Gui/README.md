# Stack Operations GUI

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing stack operations in Python using the tkinter library.

## Files

- `BasicStackGui.py`: This file contains the `Stack` and `StackApp` classes, which implement the stack operations and the GUI, respectively.

## Usage

To use the `StackApp` class, create an instance and start the main event loop of tkinter.

```python
root = tk.Tk()
app = StackApp(root)
root.mainloop() 
```
## Testing
To run the tests, navigate to the Beginner directory and run the BasicStackGuiTest.py file with Python:
    
    ```bash
    python BasicStackGuiTest.py
    ```
